# AI Text Summarizer

## ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the AI Text Summarizer App ðŸŽ‰

An application that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate concise summaries from long texts. Built using Node.js and the Hugging Face Inference API, it employs the "bart-large-cnn" model for efficient text summarization. This project is part of the Postman Student Program.

## Features

- Generate concise summaries of long articles or text inputs
- Utilizes the Hugging Face Inference API to access pre-trained AI models
- Supports easy integration for further customization and improvements

## Prerequisites

- A Hugging Face Access Token, which you can get for free by signing up at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/). The token will be used to access the summarization model

## Installation

1. **Clone the git repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anurag-adk/ai-text-summarizer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd ai-text-summarizer
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up the `.env` file as follows**

   ```bash
    PORT=your-port-number
    ACCESS_TOKEN=your-hugging-face-access-token
   ```

5. **Start the server**
   ```bash
    npm start
   ```

### Using Hugging Face

The app uses Hugging Face's Inference API to access Facebook's "bart-large-cnn" model for text summarization. Hugging Face is a community-driven platform that hosts numerous open-source models and datasets. It is like the "GitHub of AI." With a free access token, you can experiment with a variety of models for different tasks, including text classification and image generation.
